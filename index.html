								<h3>Intro to JS</h3>
								<p>My favourite project in the intro to js module was the 8-ball, The introduction to if stements
								   and what you can do with them is very important and is somthing I will continue to use.As 
								   well as the animation protion of the module I am someone who really likes animations and 
								   this helped me understande that animation can be made with code.  </p>

								<h3>Intro to HTML/CSS</h3>
								<p>The Introduction to THTML/CSS module was about leanering how to use differnt types of texts with
								   Headers,style changes which can change baound and text colors and many more.The part of the
							           module at least for that had the biggest impact I think is the style changes. I think this
			                                           becuase it makes it so you can change your website in the way you want it to be making it 
								   more special and Unique</p>
							</section>"></span>
								<h3>Advanced JS:Natural Simulations</h3>
								<p>The Advanced JS:Natural Simulation module is an expantion on the more basic intro to Js.
									The advanced Js feture some new things like floors and randoms which are very important 
									components of coding making it so that the"pc" can play as well. I think that random function 
									is the most important because I my self like making games and with the random function you can 
									add a bot that the player can go against with the random function picking loctions and movements </p>

								<h3>Algoritms</h3>
								<p>
								In the Algoritms module you learen about patterns that are found and codes and uses them to be able to change and sort data.
							        This module has given me the bases of computer programing as almost all things are Algoritms not just in computer science. An 
								example would be rubics cubes if you dont know the Algoritms for the cubes they are almost impossible to solve, this has taught
													      me that everything has some sort of pattern.

						<h3>Intro to SQL </h3>
						                 <p> The intro to SQL focuses mainly on storying data in a data base for adding, modifiying and querying that data.
									     This module has impacted me in that I know have learned a differnet way to store data in code. This is very
									     important if I want to become a software engineer as there jobs are to make software which will have to store data in them.
